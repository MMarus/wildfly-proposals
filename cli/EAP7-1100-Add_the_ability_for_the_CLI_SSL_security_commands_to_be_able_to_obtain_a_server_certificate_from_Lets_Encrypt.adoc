== Overview

WFCORE-3447 introduced high-level security commands (ssl enable-ssl-management and ssl enable-ssl-http-server)
for enabling one-way and two-way SSL easily.
To generate the server certificate,
these high-level security commands made use of key-store management operations to generate a self-signed certificate.
Since it is now possible to obtain certificates from the Let's Encrypt certificate authority using the CLI,
the high-level security commands should be updated so that in addition to being able to generate a self-signed server certificate,
they can also obtain a server certificate from Let's Encrypt.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements
* Add parameter '--lets-encrypt' to the 'enable-ssl-http-server' and 'enable-ssl-management' security commands
* The parameter '--lets-encrypt' should be used in combination with the '--interactive' parameter
* After '--lets-encrypt parameter' is used user is asked for several information needed to obtain the certificate:
** Account Key-store file name
** Account Key-store password
** Key-store file name
** Key-store password
** Certificate account name
** Contact url(s)
** Domain name(s)
** Certificate alias
** Do you agree to Let's Encrypt terms of service?
** Enable SSL Mutual Authentication
* Introduce '--ca-account=<name>' parameter to reuse existing --ca-account
** This should be used mainly in combination with --interactive and --lets-encrypt parameters
** User won't be asked to provide following items since they will be reused:
*** Account Key-store file name
*** Account Key-store password
*** Certificate account name
*** Contact url(s)
*** Do you agree to Let's Encrypt terms of service?


==== Example of the certificate interactive setup:
[source,bash]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] security enable-ssl-management --interactive --lets-encrypt
Please provide required pieces of information to enable SSL:

Info for account key-store:
File name (default accounts.keystore.jks):
Password (blank generated):

Info for certificate authority account:
Account name [admin]:
Contact email [admin@admin.com]:
Password (blank generated):
Do you agree to Let's Encrypt terms of service? y/n (blank n): y

Info for certificate key-store:
File name (default management.keystore): a
Password (blank generated):

Info for certificate:
Alias (blank generated):
Your domain name (must be accessible by the Let's Encrypt server at 80 & 443 ports) [example.com]:

Enable SSL Mutual Authentication y/n (blank n): n



Following resources will be created:

Account key store:
file: accounts.keystore.jks
password: GwA82e2S

Certificate authority account with following info:
Account name: admin
Contact email: admin@admin.com
Password: GwA82e2S
Do you agree to Let's Encrypt terms of service?: y

Certificate key-store:
File name: keystore
Password: GwA82e2S

Certificate will be obtained from Let's Encrypt server and will be valid for 90 days with:
Alias: alias-42723f73-ec17-4c84-9c20-160180490cf8
Domain name: da14549f.ngrok.io

Server account key-store file and key-store file a will be generated in server configuration directory.
Do you confirm y/n :y
